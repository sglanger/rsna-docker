# rsna-docker

Author: Steve Langer October 2017

Purpose: Provide a runtime platform for
	running user built apps (ie jars)
	in a portable environment.

Usage: see file run_docker.sh for build, run, clean
	Real user would replace all files starting with "fake"
	wither their real app, and have to update the .conf
	and .env files with their real stuff

	Follow the patterns seen in the /etc/services-config
	subfolders
